# Desktop continuation: current handoff

Branch: `feature/m7-ui-controls`; draft PR #1. Main must not be changed.

Claude M6 `5cafaa1` is now integrated, preserving Codex controls, spatial audio and Bomb
policy. The 83-clip addon, bounded soldier detail, sharper match-map textures and skin
finish refinements now use Claude's Enhanced Graphics pack manager (version 2).

Read [PACK_INTEGRATION.md](PACK_INTEGRATION.md) for the implementation, reproducible
captures, resource budgets and exact validation limits. Read [ENGINE_API.md](ENGINE_API.md)
and PR #1 comments before editing shared files.

The final full browser run has two unresolved timing checks (shot count and Casino stairs).
Focused controls/audio/Bomb/pack checks pass; direct WebRTC passes; relay was not running.
Real Intel UHD integrated-GPU measurements are recorded; discrete GPU and broader Ultra
performance validation remain pending. Do not present the 55% defender target as achieved.

Keep middle mouse ability, Q/E lean, F interaction, C vault, floor heights, the seven-float
recorder and existing relay/peer-to-peer scope. No split-screen or new backend. Do not add
game dependencies without user approval. Keep small commits and the PR in draft.

Previous subsystem context: [M7](MILESTONE_7_HANDOFF.md), [M8](MILESTONE_8_HANDOFF.md),
[Bomb policy and measurements](BOMB_BALANCE_HANDOFF.md), [graphics contract](GRAPHICS.md).
